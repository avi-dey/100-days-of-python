I think you need to re-work your 'total' function. Sometimes it'll falsely claim a player has gone bust even if they haven't, at least in my experience.

Try something along the following:

def determine_total(hand):
    total = 0
    ace_11s = 0

    for card in hand:
        if card in range(11):
            total += card
        elif card in ['J', 'K', 'Q']:
            total += 10
        else:
            total += 11
            ace_11s += 1

    while ace_11s and total > 21:
        total -= 10
        ace_11s -= 1
        
    return total

This worked 100% accurately for me.
